## Particle Filter Description

In the context of our robot localization, we have developed a comprehensive architecture for implementing a particle filter. This particle filter aims to solve the problem of localizing a robot within a given map by leveraging information from both lidar and odometry readings. The primary objective is to provide a reliable pose estimation that can subsequently be utilized in various applications, such as path planning algorithms or similar processes. While our current implementation is still a work in progress and not performing as expected, all the individual components of the particle filter have been meticulously put in place. The next steps involve rigorous testing to pinpoint the areas where the algorithm is exhibiting incorrect behavior and to refine its performance.
